			<div class="textbawah"><p>Jacquemus was born in Salon-de-Provence, France into a relatively modest family of farmers; his father sang occasionally in metal bands and his mother raised him. He grew up in the small town of Mallemort in southern France. In 2008, at the age of 18, he went to Paris, where he studied for a few months at the Ecole superiure des arts et techniques de la mode (ESMOD). He then left the program for an assistant stylist position at Citizen K fashion magazine. The sudden death of his mother prompted him to begin his own career as a fashion designer.</p></div>
